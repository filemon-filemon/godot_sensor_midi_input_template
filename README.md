This here is a template for those who want to play around with MIDI inputs in godot using sensors,
for exemple to make art installation or to build custom controllers to use with a particular game.
The importatn file in the project is node_2d.gd
It is very commented, and so there are 2 other files with almost the same name ;
node_2d_FR.gd is commented in french
node_2d_UNCOMMENTED.gd is just the code without the comments.
You can rename one of those files into ode_2d.gd or attach one of them to the node_2d node in the godot project for everything to work :)
Have fun !!
